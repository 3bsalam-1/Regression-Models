    "\n",
    "For the rest of this programming exercise, we have included the following optional exercises. These exercises will help you gain a deeper understanding of the material, and if you are able to do so, we encourage you to complete them as well. You can still submit your solutions to these exercises to check if your answers are correct.\n",

    "## 3 Linear regression with multiple variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you will implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses. Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `Data/ex1data2.txt` contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price\n",

    "We start by loading and displaying some values from this dataset. By looking at the values, note that house sizes are about 1000 times the number of bedrooms. When features differ by orders of magnitude, first performing feature scaling can make gradient descent converge much more quickly."
